As a student of BMSTU I was guided by the principles of time management and organized every necessary task, made my own calendar to track tasks, which allowed me to get good grades and get an excellent reputation with teachers. Also I defended my diploma perfectly and I was in the lists of the best students of the faculty at the 4th year of studying.</description>
