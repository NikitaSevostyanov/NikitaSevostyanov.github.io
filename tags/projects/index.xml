      <description>Description: This project is based on the RACECAR/J project, created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
The goal of this project is to design an autonomous mobile car and generate code for real mobile car that can drive according to the operator&amp;rsquo;scommands, avoiding possible obstacles (using obstacle avoidance algorithm) and path following algorithm. Also in this project the following algorithms were developed and implemented: Monte Carlo localization algorithm- to determine the location of the car in current territory based on a map created by the SLAM method (Simulteneous Localization and Mapping), joystick control is also implemented.</description>
